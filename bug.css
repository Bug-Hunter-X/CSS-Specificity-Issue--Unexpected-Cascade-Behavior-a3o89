The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon issue related to the specificity of CSS selectors and the cascade:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.container div {
  color: red; /* This rule is expected to override the first one */
}

#specific-div {
  color: green; /* This rule is expected to override the previous ones */
}

.container #specific-div {
  color: purple; /* This rule, however, unexpectedly does not override the #specific-div rule */
}
```

The expected behavior is that the `.container #specific-div` rule should override the `#specific-div` rule due to its higher specificity.  However, in some scenarios (particularly those with dynamically generated CSS or unexpected CSS loading orders), the cascade may not work as expected.  This can lead to a situation where a less specific rule still applies.

This is an uncommon error because it often stems from a misunderstanding of CSS specificity or from conflicts in how different CSS sources (e.g., internal styles, external stylesheets, inline styles) are processed and loaded.
