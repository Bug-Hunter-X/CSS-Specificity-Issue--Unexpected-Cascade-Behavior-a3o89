Several strategies can resolve the unexpected cascade behavior:

1. **Increase Specificity:**  The simplest solution is to further increase the specificity of the intended overriding rule. Add more selectors to improve specificity. For example:

```css
.container.special-container #specific-div {
  color: purple; /* This is more likely to override */
}
```

2. **Ensure Correct CSS Loading Order:**  The order in which your CSS files are loaded can affect the cascade.  Ensure that the CSS with the higher-specificity rule is loaded *after* the CSS with the lower-specificity rule. This is especially important if using multiple stylesheets. 

3. **Use !important (With Caution):** As a last resort (use with extreme caution), you can use `!important` to force the rule to override others:

```css
.container #specific-div {
  color: purple !important; /* Use sparingly! */
}
```

4. **Debugging and Inspection:** Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the computed styles and understand which rules are applied and their specificity. This will help identify the underlying cause of the problem.
