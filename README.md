# CSS Specificity Bug: Unexpected Cascade Behavior

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue related to CSS specificity and the cascade.  A more specific selector does not override a less specific selector as expected.

## Problem

The issue arises when the expected cascading order of CSS rules doesn't occur as anticipated. Although the `.container #specific-div` rule should have higher specificity, it may not always override the `#specific-div` rule.

## Cause

This is likely caused by a combination of CSS loading order, dynamic CSS generation or an unusual combination of selectors that interferes with the specificity calculation.

## Solution

The solution involves either ensuring correct CSS loading order, using more specific selectors to guarantee the correct overriding, or carefully analyzing the specificity calculation to identify and resolve conflicts.
